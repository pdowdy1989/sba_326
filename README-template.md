# Frontend Mentor - Fylo data storage component solution

This project is my solution to the [Fylo data storage component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-data-storage-component-1dZPRbV5n) on Frontend Mentor.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Repository URL: [https://github.com/pdowdy1989/sba_326](https://github.com/pdowdy1989/sba_326)
- Live Site URL: [https://pdowdy1989.github.io/sba_326/](https://pdowdy1989.github.io/sba_326/)
- Frontend Mentor Solution URL: To be added after submission

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap 5 utility classes
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I practiced combining Bootstrap layout helpers with custom CSS to match a specific design. I also improved at handling responsive background images and positioning UI elements like the storage bubble on desktop and mobile.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to:

- Improve accessibility details for icon-only elements
- Keep refining responsive spacing and typography tuning
- Build more components from static design files without relying on frameworks

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) for the challenge specification and design targets
- [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) for layout and utility class references

### AI collaboration

I used an AI coding assistant to:

- Review project structure and README completeness
- Identify missing documentation items before publishing
- Prepare git commands for pushing to GitHub
